##  APIs Used & Their Roles

**1. GeoDB Cities API (via RapidAPI)**  
Used to fetch the latitude, longitude, and country of any user-input city. This allows all other APIs to use accurate location-based data.

**2. WeatherAPI**  
Provides real-time weather information like temperature, humidity, feels-like temperature, and weather conditions for a given city.

**3. AirVisual API (IQAir)**  
Fetches current air quality metrics such as AQI (Air Quality Index) and the main pollutant for the provided location.

**4. The Cat API**  
Displays a random cat image when the entered city is invalid or any API fails, providing a lighthearted fallback.

**5. Web Speech API**  
Used for Text to Speech conversion.
